Application: Video Queue Monitoring & Processing Service

Description:
A simulated video processing application that monitors and processes uploaded videos through a queue system.
precompiled Go binary, not the source code.

This binary’s job is to:

Read the video queue length from a mock source

Export a custom metric to Cloud Monitoring:

custom.googleapis.com/opencensus/my.videoservice.org/measure/input_queue_size


The startup script runs this binary automatically on boot to simulate a live metric stream.
It consists of:

A Compute Engine instance called video-queue-monitor running a Go (Golang) application,
which generates a custom Cloud Monitoring metric:

custom.googleapis.com/opencensus/my.videoservice.org/measure/input_queue_size


→ This metric represents the length of the video input queue — the number of videos waiting to be processed.

A GKE cluster running a video processing deployment (pods that pick up and process items from the queue).
Autoscaling strategies (HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler, NAP) were applied to this deployment to ensure it scales dynamically based on:

CPU utilization (HPA)

Recommended resource limits (VPA)

Cluster-level node scaling (Cluster Autoscaler)

Dynamic node pool creation (Node Auto-Provisioning)



Purpose

The application was used to simulate a real-world workload where:

Video uploads create variable demand, and

Autoscaling must ensure that the queue is processed efficiently while minimizing idle resource cost.
